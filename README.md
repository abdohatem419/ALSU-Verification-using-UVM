# ALSU-Verification-using-UVM
The UVM verification process creates a structured environment for testing designs like the ALSU. It includes components such as sequences, drivers, monitors, scoreboards, and coverage collectors. In this setup, a sequence generates randomized inputs based on constraints. The driver applies these inputs to the DUT (Design Under Test), while the monitor observes outputs and compares them against expected results. Coverage is collected through covergroups to ensure all functional cases are tested. Assertions are added to validate the designâ€™s behavior in different scenarios, checking both valid and invalid cases. Once coverage goals are met and no errors are found, the simulation ends successfully
